Provides [emoji-mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) in plain JavaScript. This uses [remount](https://github.com/rstacruz/remount) and [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact).

In the end, you just have a custom element:

```html
<emoji-picker></emoji-picker>
```

Building:

    npm install
    npm run build
